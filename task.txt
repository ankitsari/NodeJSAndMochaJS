Write a program that processes a text file. The file will contain words in separate lines.
Implement two modes of processing:

MODE 1:
Sort the words by word length, in ascending order.
Sort words of even length alphabetically.
Output only words beginning with a vowel, discarding duplicates. 

MODE 2:
For each word, output the total number of lines in the file raised to the power of the word's length. 
if a word contains ‘x’, use the same value as for the first word not matching this condition instead.

BONUS:
Create set of functional tests proving that your solution to given problem is right.
